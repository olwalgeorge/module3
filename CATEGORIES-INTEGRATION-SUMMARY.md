## 🗄️ Database Schema Enhanced

### Categories Table Structure
```sql

- description: string (detailed description)
- parent_id: string (nullable, for hierarchical structure)
- status: enum ('active', 'inactive')
- created_at: timestamp
- updated_at: timestamp
```

### Seeded Categories (25 total)
**Main Categories (16):**
- Electronics, Clothing, Books, Sports, Home & Garden, Automotive, Health & Beauty, Toys & Games, Music, Office Supplies, Pet Supplies, Food & Beverages, Travel, Art & Crafts, Tools & Hardware, Jewelry
